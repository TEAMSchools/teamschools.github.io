# Engagement & Support Survey

## Background

We use this survey to improve organizationally. We ask research-backed questions to measure how engaged our TEAMmates are in their work, questions about how our regions are doing, school culture, and about Room 9/10/11 department performance. Regions and Room 9/10/11 departments use this survey as a key metric for their goals. Our leadership teams uses the reports from this survey to make adjustments and improve.

## Set Up

Build the roster by running [query](https://github.com/TEAMSchools/gabby/blob/f8ac099cf6f3e6330d105dfdd1cb6d8460ff7c5b/extracts/adhoc/q_survey_roster_cmo_regional_engagement.sql) in SQL and assigning via INDEX-MATCH in [PM Management document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d84x7HHOMgnQM78dYLY9vHqf-jLfYmpH8YGHEDezGNs/edit#gid=135768229).  

As part of Self & Others survey audit, DSOs can adjust assignments as needed.

## Building Questions

Create display logic for new pages/questions assign values for responses as needed. Test links as different members of staff (CMO, school-based) to ensure questions display correctly for different groups.

Aliasing question names allows us to change question text in different survey rounds and match to the same one in different versions.
